          <h2>Wholegrains</h2>
          <img src="../images/wholegrains.jpg" />
          <p>
            Eating whole grains like brown rice, oats, and quinoa is beneficial
            for health due to their high fiber content, which aids in digestion
            and helps maintain a healthy weight by keeping you fuller for
            longer. Whole grains are also rich in essential nutrients such as B
            vitamins, iron, and magnesium, which support various bodily
            functions including energy production and immune system health.
            Additionally, regular consumption of whole grains has been linked to
            a reduced risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and
            certain cancers.

          <h2>Fruits and Vegetables</h2>
          <img src="../images/fruitsveg.jpg" class="responsive-img" />
          <p>
            Fruits and vegetables are packed with essential vitamins, minerals,
            and antioxidants that are vital for overall health and well-being.
            They help reduce inflammation, boost the immune system, and protect
            against a variety of diseases, including heart disease, stroke, and
            certain types of cancer. The high fiber content in fruits and
            vegetables supports digestive health and helps prevent constipation.
            Additionally, the wide range of phytochemicals found in these foods
            can improve skin health, enhance vision, and promote a healthy aging
            process.

          <h2>Protiens</h2>
          <img src="../images/protein.jpg" />
          <p>
            Including adequate protein in your diet is crucial for maintaining
            and repairing tissues, producing enzymes and hormones, and
            supporting muscle growth and strength. High-quality protein sources
            like lean meats, fish, eggs, beans, and nuts provide essential amino
            acids that the body cannot produce on its own. Protein also plays a
            key role in weight management by promoting satiety and reducing
            overall calorie intake. Furthermore, protein-rich diets can improve
            bone health and enhance the bodyâ€™s ability to recover from injury or
            illness.
