                    <p>We need to eat a wide variety of foods in the right amounts to meet our daily nutritional needs. Eating healthier, balanced meals does not have to be complicated.</p>
                    <p>My Healthy Plate is an easy-to-understand visual guide, designed by Health Promotion Board. It helps you adopt healthier eating habits, which in turn can help you better manage your weight and ward off chronic diseases.</p>
                    <p>Quarter, Quarter, Half is an easy way to remember the right proportions of each food group in a well-balanced meal. Here's how:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fill Quarter plate with wholegrains</li>
                            <li>Fill Quarter plate with good sources of protein</li>
                            <li>Fill Half plate with fruit and vegetables</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>If you are unable to find a meal that fits the Quarter, Quarter, Half proportions, you can make up the missing food groups in your next meal.</p>
                    <p>*Recommended plate is 10 inch in diameter</p>

            <p>Incorporate a range of entire foods, such as fruits, vegetables, lean meats, whole grains, and healthy fats, into your diet for a well-rounded and nutrient-dense intake. Eat as much vegetables as possible to provide a wide variety of vitamins and minerals. Drink lots of water to stay hydrated, and cut less on processed meals, sugar, and high-sodium snacks. Maintaining a healthy weight and enhancing digestion can also be achieved through mindful eating practices including slowing down and observing hunger cues.</p>
